    <p>See console for output.</p>
    <!-- Create an unordered list with any questions you have -->
    <ul>
      <li> Can we put arrays inside of arrays? If so: <ul>
        <li> are there limits on how "deep" our nested arrays can go?</li>
        <li> do we have to worry about dimensions, so that each nested array
          is the same length and we have a nice [n by m] or [n by m by l] matrix
          , or can we just go crazy?</li>
      </ul> </li>
      <li> Should I comment out the console logs that I used to test my code in cart.js?</li>
    </ul>
